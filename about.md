## Where Geology Meets Gastronomy
Welcome to Mine & Morsel, born from a passion where the richness of the earth meets the art of edible design. 

I'm a geologist by day and my fascination with the beauty of rocks and minerals runs deep. Just like a carefully unearthed gem, I found an equally compelling passion in crafting beautiful, abundant charcuterie grazing tables.

Inspired by Pittsburgh's rich coal mining history and my personal love for geology, Mine & Morsel brings a unique, grounded elegance to every event. I believe that every gathering, no matter the size, deserves to be memorable and special. That's why I create expansive, artfully arranged grazing tables that are as much a feast for the eyes as they are for the palate.

What started as a personal joy of building charcuterie boards has evolved into Mine & Morsel—an outlet to share this edible art more broadly. I enjoy selecting gourmet cheeses, savory meats, fresh fruits, and delectable accompaniments, arranging them with a touch of geological inspiration. My aim is to create an unforgettable experience that sparks conversation and leaves a lasting impression.

At Mine & Morsel, I am dedicated to making your memories shine, one beautifully crafted "morsel" at a time. And don't worry, I promise the geology-inspired theme is optional and just the right amount of "cheesy" – in the best way possible!
